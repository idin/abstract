Description: # *Abstract*
        Abstract is a Python library for creating and drawing graphs 
        and taking advantage of graph properties.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install abstract
        ```

        ```
        
        ## *Graph*
        
        ### Introduction
        In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that 
        is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph 
        concepts from mathematics; specifically, the field of graph theory. 
        [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type))
        
        A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) 
        set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of 
        unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or 
        a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known 
        as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
        directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. 
        The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external 
        entities represented by integer indices or references. 
        [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type))
        
        
        
        ### Usage
        The *Graph* class allows you to create nodes and edges and 
        visualize the resulting graph. Edges can have direction which
        indicates parent-child relationship.
        
        To construct a new graph, use *Graph()*.
        ```python
        from abstract import Graph
        
        graph = Graph()
        ```
        
        ### *add_node*
        The *add_node* method creates a node in the graph 
        and returns a *Node* object. 
        
        It takes the following arguments:
        * *name*: name of the new node (should be unique); snake case is recommended
        * *label* (optional): it can be any string, if it is missing the name will be displayed
        * *value* (optional): can be any object
        * *style* (optional): it should be a *NodeStyle* object and is only used for rendering
        * *if_node_exists*: what to do if a node with this name exists 
        and can be 'warn', 'error', or 'ignore'; default is 'warn'
        
        
        ```python
        node_order = [
            'scissors', 'paper', 'rock', 'lizard', 'Spock', 'scissors',
            'lizard', 'paper', 'Spock', 'rock', 'scissors'
        ]
        
        # add nodes (avoid duplicates)
        for node in set(node_order):
            node = graph.add_node(name=node)
        ```
        
        ### *connect* (add an edge)
        The *connect* method creates an edge from a *start* node to an *end* node. 
        The *start* and *end* arguments can be either names of nodes or the *Node* objects.
        
        ```python
        for index in range(len(node_order)-1):
            edge = graph.connect(start=node_order[index], end=node_order[index+1])
        ```
        
        ### *get_node*
        To retrieve a node from the graph you can use the *get_node* method 
        which returns a *Node* object.
        ```python
        rock = graph.get_node('rock')
        ```
        
        ### *draw* (*render*)
        The *render* method visualizes the graph and if a *path* is provided it saves it
        to an image file that can be a *pdf* or *png*. The file format is infered from 
        the *path* argument. The *draw* method is just an alias for *render*.
        
        ```python
        # just visualize the graph
        graph.draw()
        ```
        ![image of the graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idin/abstract/master/pictures/rock_paper.png)
        
        
        ```python
        # save as a png file and view the file
        graph.draw(path='my_graph.png', view=True)
        
        ```
        
        ### *Graph(obj)*
        You can create a graph from any object that has a "*\_\_graph\_\_()*" method. 
        Examples of such objects are: 
        * *Graph* class from this library
        * *Pensieve* class from the [pensieve](https://pypi.org/project/pensieve/) library
        
        ```python
        from pensieve import Pensieve
        from abstract import Graph
        
        pensieve = Pensieve()
        pensieve['one'] = 1
        pensieve['two'] = 2
        pensieve.store(key='three', precursors=['one', 'two'], function=lambda x: x['one'] + x['two'])
        graph = Graph(pensieve)
        ```
        
        ### *draw_graph*
        In case you just want to draw the graph of an object or create a graph and immediately render it
        you can just use the *draw_graph* method. It accepts anything that the *Graph* class accepts.
        
        ```python
        from pensieve import Pensieve
        from abstract import draw_graph
        
        pensieve = Pensieve()
        pensieve['one'] = 1
        pensieve['two'] = 2
        pensieve.store(key='three', precursors=['one', 'two'], function=lambda x: x['one'] + x['two'])
        draw_graph(pensieve)
        ```
        
        
        ## Future Features
        
        * Create a graph from:
          * list of dictionaries
          * dataframe
        * Create a new graph by filtering a graph
